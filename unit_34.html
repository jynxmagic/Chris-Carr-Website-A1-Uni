						<h2>Computer System Fundamentals</h2>
						<p>Computer System Fundamentals contains 2 subject areas: Discrete Mathmatics and Electronic Engineering</p>
						<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Discrete Mathmatics</h3>
						<p>In Discrete Mathmatics we have covered a few areas, ranging from Sets and Matrics to Vectors and Units.</p>
						<p>I enjoyed learning about Sets, as they remind me very much of Arrays in any language, as they are a variable containg X amount of entries.</p>
						<p>Matrics were also fun to learn about as they were just a variation of sets.</p>
						<p>We have just begun work on Vectors and Units, and so far the work involved is very interesting.</p>
						<p>Maths has always been fun for me as it is almost like another language to learn.</p>
						<h3 style="font-size: 2em;">Electronic Engineering</h3>
						<p>Electronic Engineering is probably the hardest out of all of the units that we have been doing.</p>
						<p>It involves: creating truth tables, creating and simplifying boolean algebra, drawing circuits in logisim and creating Karnaugh Maps.</p>
						<p>We have recently took a test for Electronic Engineering, and I'm hoping to have scored a high grade!!!</p>
						<p>I think that the end goal of electronic engineering will be to create circuits and be able to "teach" those circuits to do something in assembly language.</p>

						<h2>Programming</h2>
						<p>Another awesome subject!</p>
						<p>We haven't begun programming with actual Java yet, but we have been programming in something called Processing, which is a very simplified form of the java runtime environment. Here is a link to the Processing website: <a href="https://processing.org/" style="color: red">https://processing.org/</a></p>
						<p>We have also recently took a programming test, and I'm hoping for high grades in this as well.</p>
						<p>Hopefully, we'll be moving onto more intricate Java work soon, dealing with database connection and handing APIs.</p>
